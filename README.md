# PointCloudSplitter
PointCloudSplitter splits huge laser scan point cloud pts files into multiple smaller cubes.
 GPLv2-licensed.
 
 
## Installation 
PointCloudSplitter does not come with a fancy install program. The reason for this is that all you need is one exe file (and the program does not depend on settings in registry). 

All configuration is done via a XML file. A sample configuration file called **Standard.config** is provided in the download section. 

* Verify that you have Microsoft .net4 installed on your computer [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785/en-us](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785/en-us) 
* Download and unzip PointCloudSplitter.exe. 
* Place the exe file in a suitable folder 
* Download the sample config file called **Standard.config** 
* Place the Standard.config file in a suitable folder 
* Edit Standard.config in a text editor such as notepad. Refer this page [The Configuration file](The-Configuration-file) for information about how to edit the configuration file
